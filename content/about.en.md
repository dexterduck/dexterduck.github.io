I'm currently a senior data scientist at {{< link content="Sibel Health" href="https://sibelhealth.com/" >}}. I focus primarily on data and feature engineering, with a particular interest in designing high-performance data pipelines.

I was previously a lead software engineer at {{< link content="Blackrock Neurotech" href="https://blackrockneurotech.com/" >}} where I led development of the {{< link content="MoveAgain" href="https://blackrockneurotech.com/blackrock-neurotechs-moveagain-brain-computer-interface-system-receives-breakthrough-device-designation-from-the-fda/" >}} BCI project. As part of that work I developed and open-sourced {{< link content="ella" href="https://github.com/CerebusOSS/ella" >}}, a low-latency time-series datastore written in Rust.

Starting in 2018 I was the head of software engineering at {{< link content="MindX" href="https://www.mind-x.io/" >}} until its acquisition by Blackrock in 2022.
